    "classic_system_prompt": "You are participating in a competitive logic deduction game called Turing Machine.\nYour goal is to win first place by deducing a secret 3-digit code with minimal rounds and verifier usage, but accuracy takes priority over speed.\n\nGame Objective:\n- Deduce the secret 3-digit code made up of digits 1-5.\n- BLUE = first digit, YELLOW = second digit, PURPLE = third digit.\n- Each digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (digits may repeat).\n- The code is the ONLY combination that satisfies the active criterion of ALL chosen verifiers.\n\nGame Structure (Rounds):\n1. Proposal: Design a 3-digit code to test (format: BLUE=X, YELLOW=Y, PURPLE=Z, where X, Y, Z are digits from 1 to 5).\n2. Question: Sequentially choose 0 to 3 verifiers to test your proposed code each round. After each selection, you will see the result, and then you can decide whether to select the next one.\n3. Deduce: Based on verifier results, you can submit a final answer or continue to the next round.\n4. End Round: If you didn't submit a final answer, a new round begins.\n\nVerifier Rules:\n- Each verifier checks ONE specific property (criterion) about the code.\n- Each verifier has multiple potential criteria, but for each game, only ONE is secretly selected as 'active'. You don't know which criterion is active for any given verifier.\n- Focus of Verification: When testing your code against a verifier, it **exclusively** evaluates it against its **single, active criterion**. The verifier completely ignores all other potential criteria, including its own inactive ones.\n- PASS Condition: A verifier returns `<PASS>` if and only if your code satisfies this single active criterion. A `<PASS>` confirms *only* that this specific rule was met by the tested code.\n- FAIL Condition: A verifier returns `<FAIL>` **if and only if** your code does not satisfy this single active criterion. A `<FAIL>` indicates *only* that this specific rule was violated by the tested code.\n- Non-Overlapping Information: The active criteria selected across different verifiers for a game will provide distinct information.\n\n\nWinning Strategy:\n- It is possible to deduce the solution through joint reasoning, utilizing the combined results of multiple verifiers along with system rules such as the existence of a unique solution and the principle that no two verifiers offer redundant information.\n- Only submit a final guess when you have either tested all verifiers and received <PASS> for each, or when your reasoning clearly proves your code satisfies all possible active verifier criteria. Accuracy takes priority over speed.\n\nCurrent Game Setup:\n{game_setup}\n",

For example, if Verifier 1 is secretly mapped to Verifier 2, then a <PASS> from Verifier 1 means your code met Verifier 2's hidden active rule.\n- FAIL Condition: A verifier returns `<FAIL>` if and only if your code does not satisfy the active criterion of the actual Verifier it is mapped to. A <FAIL> simply means the mapped Verifier's rule was not met.\n- Non-Overlapping Information: The active criteria selected across different verifiers for a game will provide distinct information. \n\nWinning Strategy:\n- It is possible to deduce the solution through joint reasoning, utilizing the combined results of multiple verifiers along with system rules such as the existence of a unique solution and the principle that no two verifiers offer redundant information.\n- One possible strategy is to carefully modify your code across multiple rounds and observe how each Verifier’s output changes.
